# Pwnagotchi-WiFi-AutoSwap
An automated setup script for Bettercap on Raspberry Pi that dynamically switches between internal and external Wi-Fi adapters based on availability. Supports hotplugging of Alfa AWUS036NHA, auto-configures monitor mode, whitelists home SSIDs, and integrates with systemd for seamless boot-time activation. No overlay changes required.
